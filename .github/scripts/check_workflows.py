"""Lint the GitHub Actions workflows in this repo, samples included.

    python3 .github/scripts/check_workflows.py

Fails when:
  - a `uses:` is not pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA (local ./
    actions excepted). A tag can be moved to point at different code.
  - the workflow-level permissions grant id-token or any write scope. Grant
    those per job.
  - a job with id-token: write has no `environment:`. The environment is what
    the federated credential trusts, and where reviewers or branch rules stop
    an edited workflow from minting a token.

intune/pipelines/github/ is left out while that layer moves to its own repo.
