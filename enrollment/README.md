# enrollment

One consumer per downstream system, each converging its own system towards the
inventory projection it was handed. No orchestrator, no ordering, no shared
state.

```

         ├── intune.csv  ──> consumers/intune.py   builds the group ladder
         ├── cimian.csv  ──> consumers/cimian.py   publishes computers.csv

```

## Three properties that make this survivable

**Independent failure.** The blast radius of a bad deploy is one system. If the
print-server consumer is broken, Cimian and Intune neither know nor care.

**No ordering.** Every consumer converges its own system towards the same row,
so the order they run in affects only how long the estate is briefly
inconsistent, not what it converges to.

**Idempotent by construction.** Every consumer is written as "make my system
match this row", never "apply this change". Re-run one twice and the second run
does nothing. You will replay these, usually at the worst moment, and a
consumer that applies deltas will happily apply the same delta twice.

## Running one

Everything plans before it writes:

```
python3 ../inventory/projections/project.py ../inventory/inventory.csv --out-dir out/
python3 -m consumers.intune out/intune.csv --what-if
```

With no `GRAPH_TOKEN` set, the Intune consumer prints the group plan and stops
without making a single call. That is the first thing to run after forking —
look at the ladder it would build before giving it credentials.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `shared/hierarchy.py` | The naming convention. Inventory columns to group ladder to manifest path, and back. Nothing else builds a group name by hand. |
| `shared/graph.py` | Thin Graph client: paging, group cache, throttle, whatIf. `requests` is imported lazily so the tests need no dependencies. |
| `shared/guards.py` | Desired-set floor and removal cap. These only ever constrain removal. |
| `shared/csvdiff.py` | Change detection against a cached copy, with `FULL_RUN` and `BYPASS_CACHE`. |
| `consumers/` | One module per target system. Imports nothing cloud-specific. |
| `triggers/azure-blob/` | Azure Functions doorbell. |
| `triggers/generic-webhook/` | The same consumers behind plain HTTP. |
| `tests/` | In-memory Graph. No network, no credentials, runs in a second. |

The split between `consumers/` and `triggers/` is the load-bearing one. The blob
trigger is an Azure detail; the convergence logic is not. Keeping the consumers
free of Functions imports is what lets the same code run on a cron box, in a
GitHub Action, or behind the Flask app in `triggers/generic-webhook/`.

## Guards

Adding devices to groups is safe. Removing them is not, and the two failure
modes are worth naming:

- **A collapsed parse.** A wrong path, a shallow checkout, a renamed column —
  the desired set degrades to near-zero, which is a well-formed answer that
  empties every group on a green build. Caught by `desired_floor`.
- **A runaway change.** A bulk edit that moves eight hundred machines because
  somebody sorted a spreadsheet wrong. Caught by `removal_cap`, which skips the
  suspicious group and carries on with the rest rather than failing everything.

Both read their thresholds from the environment. Set them from *your* baseline
and record that baseline in a comment. Defaults inherited from someone else's
estate are decorations, not guards.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MIN_DESIRED_MEMBERSHIPS` | `10` | Floor below which a run is treated as a parse failure |
| `MAX_REMOVAL_PCT` | `10` | Percentage of a group that one run may remove |
| `WHATIF` | unset | `true` to log every write instead of making it |
| `FULL_RUN` | unset | `true` to process every row regardless of the cache |
| `INTUNE_GROUP_PREFIX` | `Devices` | First component of every group name |

## Tests

```
python3 tests/test_group_ladder.py
```

Eleven assertions against an in-memory Graph: the ladder shape, the
manifest-path round trip, retired devices never being added, a second run
changing nothing, a collapsed parse removing nothing, a runaway removal being
capped, and whatIf writing nothing.

Gate every sync on these. They are the cheapest insurance in the kit.
