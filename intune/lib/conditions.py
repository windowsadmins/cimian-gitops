"""Translate a Munki condition into an Intune assignment-filter rule.

ONE copy, imported by both the lint stage and the assign stages. In the
production pipeline this logic exists twice with a comment between the copies
saying "keep these in sync", which is a module wearing a disguise. This is the
module.

Munki evaluates conditions on the device against facts it collects locally, so
a Munki condition can reference almost anything. An assignment filter can only
reference the handful of properties the MDM holds. Everything hard about this
file comes from that gap.

Supported:
    hostname        == != CONTAINS BEGINSWITH ENDSWITH
    device_category == !=
    os_vers_major   == != >= <= > <
    AND, OR, NOT, parentheses

Not supported, and deliberately loud about it:
    arch, serial_number, catalogs, machine_model, machine_type, any custom fact

machine_type is the interesting difference from the macOS translator: there,
Apple's marketing names carry the form factor, so "laptop" maps to a model-name
prefix. Windows has no equivalent convention, so form factor has to come from
deviceCategory, which somebody has to set.
