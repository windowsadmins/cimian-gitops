# inventory

One row per device, twelve columns, in whatever system your organisation already
edits. Everything downstream is a projection of this.

The product holding these columns is an implementation detail. Snipe-IT, Jamf
Pro inventory, ServiceNow, a Postgres view, a spreadsheet exported on a
schedule — all satisfy the contract. What matters is that there is exactly one
place a human edits the description of a device, and that everyone agrees what
the columns mean.

## The column contract

| Column | Decides |
|---|---|
| `serial` | The join key. Every downstream system keys on this. |
| `asset` | The asset tag on the sticker — what a human quotes at you. |
| `platform` | Which agent owns the machine. This kit's sample fleet is all `Windows`. |
| `catalog` | The software tier: Staff, Faculty, Curriculum, Kiosk, Provisioning. |
| `area` | The department or functional grouping. |
| `location` | The room. |
| `usage` | `Assigned` (one person) or `Shared` (many). The most load-bearing column. |
| `status` | Active, Retired, Lost, New. Decides whether the device should exist in any system. |
| `allocation` | Human-readable "who or what this is" — a person, or a lab bench. |
| `username` | The account that gets the primary-user association. Empty on shared devices. |
| `hostname` | What the machine calls itself. |
| `fleet` | Optional sub-grouping for anything the above doesn't capture. |

`usage`, `catalog`, `area` and `location` are four levels of one hierarchy, in
that order, broadest to narrowest. That ordering is the whole architecture:

```
inventory columns   usage / catalog / area / location
Entra group ladder  Devices-{usage}-{catalog}-{area}-{location}
manifest path       manifests/{usage}/{catalog}/{area}.yaml
```

A group name and a manifest path are the same address written twice.

## The vocabulary is closed

`catalog`, `area`, `usage` and `status` are closed value sets, not free text.

A stray value does not raise an error. It creates a new Entra group with one
device in it and a manifest path that resolves to nothing, and the device
quietly stops receiving software. Renaming a value is a migration with an
order — create the new value everywhere, move the rows, confirm devices landed,
retire the old value — not an edit.

Treat the vocabulary like a database schema. It is acting as a foreign key
across every system you manage.

## What is deliberately absent

- **Hardware facts** (model, CPU, RAM, storage). Every management system
  collects these better than a human types them. If it is discoverable, it is
  not inventory's job.
- **Compliance and patch state.** A fact about right now, not a description of
  the device. That belongs in reporting.
- **Group names, manifest paths, policy IDs.** These are derived. Storing a
  derived value creates a second source of truth, which is the problem this
  whole kit exists to remove.
- **Purchase and lease data.** Real, and a different projection of the same
  asset for a different consumer — not part of this contract.

## Projecting

```
python3 projections/project.py inventory.csv --out-dir out/
```

Writes one narrowed CSV per target into `out/`. Each target receives only the
columns it can act on, and platform-specific targets receive only their own
rows:

| Target | Rows | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| `cimian.csv` | Windows | `../enrollment/consumers/cimian.py` |
| `munki.csv` | Macintosh | the Munki repo's equivalent consumer |
| `intune.csv` | all | `../enrollment/consumers/intune.py` — builds the group ladder |
| `mdm.csv` | all | `../enrollment/consumers/mdm.py` — ADE / Autopilot routing |

Add a target by adding an entry to `COLUMNS` in `project.py`, and to `PLATFORM`
if it only wants one platform.

## Sample data

`inventory.csv` is an invented fleet — made-up serials, asset tags, rooms and
people, at `example.ca`. It covers both usages, five catalogs and four rooms, so
the group ladder it produces is worth looking at. The macOS half of the same
fleet lives in the Munki repo; the contract is identical.

Before publishing your own version of any export like this, grep for: names in
file paths, serial numbers, asset tags, tenant and subscription IDs, repository
GUIDs, storage account names, service connection names, webhook URLs and
internal hostnames.
